## Abstract

This ZenIP describes the consensus rule changes of the proposed enhancements to Zen v3.1.0. The consensus rule changes will activate via a hard fork at mainchain block height #1127000.
The consensus rules will include the following changes:
* a new field `version` is added to sidechain creation transactions (txtype -4) inside the Sidechain Creation Output (vsc_ccout)
* the treasury addresses for ZBF Treasury, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes will change (coinbase transaction vout[1,2,3])

In addition the following API changes are made:
* new fields added to `getblocktemplate` RPC command
* new API to retrieve all versions for specified sidechain IDs
* new value pair added to extend the `getscgenesisinfo` RPC command


## Motivation

The enhancements fix an issue with the management of `Custom Fields` included in certificates. They also extend functionality for block template requests. These enhancements have already been implemented with v3.1.0.

The change of Treasury addresses is motivated by the changing global security environment. To increase security, the 3-of-5 multisig signature scheme is changed to 4-of-7. In addition the key holders are now distributed over three separate entities, Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF), Horizen Community Council (HCC) and Horizen Labs (HL).

## Specification

**Sidechain Versioning**

In previous zend versions, the `withdrawalEpoch` field was a 4 byte unsigned integer containing the withdrawal epoch length. The maximum valid withdrawal epoch length was limited or capped to 4032.
In zend 3.1.0, the `withdrawalEpochLength` field is split into two separate fields, as follows.
1. A 1 byte field for `version`
2. A 3 byte field for `withdrawalEpochLength`
             

As shown above, the first (most significant byte) of the withdrawalEpochLength is used for the sidechain version. Sidechain versions before this change are assumed to be set to `0`.
Note: Because of the versioning change, version 3.1.0 is incompatible with all previous versions. Previous versions cannot be used with this hard fork.

**Treasury Address Changes**


The Mainnet coinbase vout addresses will change at block **#1127000**:
|Type |From|To|
|---|---|---|
|Treasury|zszpcLB6C5B8QvfDbF2dYWXsrpac5DL9WRk |zshX5BAgUvNgM1VoBVKZyFVVozTDjjJvRxJ| 
|Secure Nodes|zsxWnyDbU8pk2Vp98Uvkx5Nh33RFzqnCpWN |zsx68qSKMNoc1ZPQpGwNFZXVzgf27KN6a9u| 
|Super Nodes|zsnL6pKdzvZ1BPVzALUoqw2KsY966XFs5CE |zszMgcogAqz49sLHGV22YCDFSvwzwkfog4k|

Reward percentages will stay unchanged.


**Block Template Request Extensions**

The `getblocktemplate` method includes two additional return values, based on the optional parameter `roots`:
 
| Key | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| merkleTree | no  | string  | Merkleroot calculated on transactions and certificates |
| scTxsCommitment | no | string | Calculated on certificates |

*Note: If you construct `coinbasetxn` outside of zend, use `getblockmerkleroots` RPC to calculate these values.

**Sidechain versioning**

The `GET_SIDECHAINS_VERSIONS` websocket API returns sidechain versions for provided sidechain IDs.

The Sidechain Creation Output now includes sidechain version information. The `sc_create`, `createrawtransaction`, and `getscinfo` RPC commands are updated to include the `version` argument. This field is now mandatory when creating a new sidechain. Also, the `version` field has been added to `CTxScCreationOut` and `ScFixedParamaters`; it is stored in the first byte of the `withdrawalEpochLength`. The `sidechainVersion` parameter is added to `GetFieldElement`.

**`getscgensisinfo`extensions**

The `getscgenesisinfo` RPC command includes a new list of pairs (`sidechain_id`, `sidechain_version`) for each certificate published in the sidechain genesis block.
This is helpful in correctly computing the cumulative commitment tree root hash, especially as the sidechain bootstrapping tool deserializes custom fields included in certificates published by other sidechains.
