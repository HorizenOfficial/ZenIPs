## Abstract

This ZenIP describes the enhancements to Zen v3.1.0. This version is a mandatory upgrade and includes the following:
* new fields to `getblocktemplate` RPC command
* new API to retrieve all versions for specified sidechain IDs
* new value pair added to extend the `getscgenesisinfo` RPC commmand


## Motivation

The enhancements extend functionality for block template requests and to identify both sidechain versions and IDs together. These enhancements have already been implemented with v3.1.0.

## Specification

*Block Template Request Extensions*

The `getblocktemplate` method includes two additional return values, based on the optional parameter `roots`:
 
| Key | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| merkleTree | no  | string  | Merkleroot calculated on transactions and certificates |
| scTxsCommitment | no | string | Calculated on certificates |

*Note: If you construct `coinbasetxn` outside of zend, use `getblockmerkleroots` RPC to calculate these values.

*Sidechain versioning*

The `GET_SIDECHAINS_VERSIONS` websocket API returns sidechain versions for provided sidechain IDs.

The Sidechain Creation Output now includes sidechain version information. The `sc_create`, `createrawtransaction`, and `getscinfo` RPC commands are updated to include the `version` argument. This field is now mandatory when creating a new sidechain. Also, the `version` field is stored in `CTxScCreationOut`, `withdrawalEpochLength`, and `ScFixedParamaters`. The `sidechainVersion` parameter is added to `GetFieldElement`.

*`getscgensisinfo`extensions*

The `getscgenesisinfo` RPC command includes` a new list of pairs (`sidechain_id`, `sidechain_version`) for each certificate published in the sidechain genesis block.
This is helpful in correctly computing the cumulative commitment tree root hash, especially as the sidechain bootstrapping tool deserializes custom fields included in certificates published by other sidechains.

## Notes

* Users of zencashjs should upgrade to an upcoming version to be released soon, which adds compatibility for serialization of sidechain creation version fields in -4 transactions.

* Exchanges and Partners: you will not be able to access your funds until you upgrade to the latest version.

* Pool operators: ZEND will not work and thus you will not be able to mine ZEN until you upgrade to ZEN 3.1.0. As the coinbase treasury addresses are changing, modifications to mining pool software will be needed. S-nomp and node-stratum-pool have been made compatible with the testnet and mainnet hard forks already.

* Node operators: ZEND will not work and thus you will not be eligible to earn ZEN until you upgrade to ZEN 3.1.0.

* Full node wallet users (Swing wallet, Sphere by Horizen): you will not be able to access your funds until you upgrade to the latest wallet version.
