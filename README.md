# ZenIPs

Horizen Improvement Proposals for the [Horizen Ecosystem](https://www.horizen.io).
Participation in the Horizen project is subject to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zenips/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

## Motivation

The Horizen Improvement Proposal System (ZenIP) standardizes the process of suggesting major changes to the Horizen code base and processes. A ZenIP is a document that describes a proposed new feature. It explains the rationale behind the proposed feature and elaborates on why certain design decisions were made.

## Specification

When approving ZenIPs, we try not to be too involved in decision-making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred. Having a ZenIP in this repository does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active. 

The full specification of the ZenIP process can be found in [ZenIP-42000](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zenips/blob/master/zenip-42000.md).
