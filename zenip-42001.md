## Abstract

The goal of this proposal is to remove certain ZenIP editors and propose their replacements, and to clarify the process around making changes to the ZenIP editors.

## Motivation

Given recent personnel changes at the Horizen Community Council (HCC) and Horizen Labs, it is necessary to update the ZenIP editors representing both organizations. Peter Stewart and Maurizio Binello have tendered their resignations from their respective organizations, necessitating replacement ZenIP editors.
We are also using this opportunity to propose a change to simplify the editor replacement process should a similar scenario occur in the future.

## Specification
The proposed changes to the ZenIP editors are as follows:

Horizen Community Council
- REMOVE Peter Steward
- ADD Pier Stabilini 
- ADD Gustavo Fialho

Horizen Labs:
- REMOVE Maurizio Binello
- ADD Zain Cheng

Additionally, henceforth when a ZenIP editor leaves the organization which he or she represents, he or she will be automatically removed as ZenIP editor and the organization will nominate a replacement via ZenIP.
