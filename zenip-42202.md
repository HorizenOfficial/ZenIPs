## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](#references).

## Abstract

This document introduces a new type of sidechain that never ceases from processing cross-chain transactions. The version for this type of sidechains is “v2”.

### Problem statement

For sidechains v0 and v1, a `withdrawalEpochLength > 0` must be specified at the time of creation. This value determines the length of the epoch and when a submission window opens and closes for each epoch. 

The life cycle of any sidechain is composed of epochs, which are sets of consecutive blocks whose size is defined by the `withdrawalEpochLength`. The first epoch begins with the block that creates the sidechain, the second epoch starts after a `withdrawalEpochLength` number of blocks, and so on.

At the beginning of every epoch (except for the first one), there is a subset of blocks that constitutes the **submission window**, during which the sidechain is required to publish at least one certificate for the previous epoch. Any certificate received outside this window is automatically rejected.

Certificates are the only way to move coins back to the mainchain.

If a sidechain doesn’t provide at least one certificate for an epoch, it is considered “ceased” and no more transactions to or from the sidechain are accepted. Only *Ceased Sidechain Withdrawals* are allowed as an emergency procedure to recover funds.

### Proposal

The proposal is to introduce sidechains v2 that are not required to submit certificates during a submission window and can continue to process transactions without the risk of ceasing.

The non-ceasing behavior is optional for sidechains v2. It must be enabled by setting the `withdrawalEpochLength` to “0”.

Sidechains v2 will have two different behaviors based on the creation parameters:

- if the `withdrawalEpochLength` is set to “0”, the sidechain never ceases

- if the `withdrawalEpochLength` is greater than “0”, the sidechain works exactly as sidechains v0 and v1 with ceasing behavior

## Motivation

The sidechain mechanism introduced in the Horizen blockchain with “Zendoo“ was designed and implemented for a fully decentralized scenario.

The ceasing mechanism introduced with “Zendoo” was conceived for a fully permissionless and decentralized scenario. With time we realized that the former was making it hard in a certain number of use cases to follow the rules.

There are cases in which is not economically efficient to send a certificate if there is no data to include, or cases in which the missed slot doesn't depend on the parties' will (i.e. a bug in a sidechain client). Moreover, it happens exactly the opposite when someone can benefit to send the certificate the soonest.

That's why we are proposing to relax the security constraints.

We still believe that for fully decentralized sidechains, the `Mainchain Backward Transfer Request` (MBTR) and the `Ceased Sidechain Withdrawal` (CSW) are valuable. MBTR guarantees the withdrawal of funds directly from mainchain in case the sidechain is compromised (but continues to publish certificates), while, if the sidechain ceases, funds can be withdrawn with CSW. Where the most valuable thing to preserve is not Zen, MBTR and CSW are less important (e.g. in a sidechain implementing a smart contracting platform, tokens or agreements won't be recoverable using those features).

In sidechains where the assumption of keeping an honest majority is valid, users can rely on the Backward Transfer mechanism triggered on the sidechain itself. Moreover, having fixed certificate submission windows may lead to unwanted or unexpected ceasing due to a variety of reasons:

- bugs in the software running the nodes

- connectivity issues

The proposed changes can mitigate such risks without affecting the security of the sidechain.

## Specification

The creation of sidechains v2 is triggered by the consensus rules starting with the activation of fork point #10.

Any attempt to create a sidechain v2 on mainnet before that height SHALL be rejected.

Sidechains v2 SHALL include all the features in sidechains v1.
A Sidechains v2 registered with `withdrawalEpochLength = "0"` MUST activate the optional non-ceasing behavior.
A Sidechains v2 registered with `withdrawalEpochLength <> "0"` MUST activate the traditional ceasing behavior as it is intended for sidechains v0 and v1.

### Constraints

Sidechains v2 MUST never cease when setting `withdrawalEpochLength` to "0" at creation time. They are not forced to publish certificates during fixed submission windows. They have, though, some constraints:

- The `epoch` values of certificates MUST be consecutive (i.e. after a certificate of epoch N the following one MUST refer to epoch N + 1)

- The `quality` mechanism is disabled, so SHALL NOT be possible to publish two or more certificates for the same epoch

These non-ceasable sidechains MUST satisfy the following constraints:

- **Sidechain Creation / Registration in the case of non-ceasible behavior**
  
  - A Sidechains v2 creation transaction with non-ceasible behavior MUST disable MBTR (by setting `mainchainBackwardTransferRequestDataLength` to 0.
  - A Sidechains v2 creation transaction with non-ceasible behavior MUST disable CSW (by having `wCeasedVk` empty).
  
- **Certificates**

  - If the mainchain first receives a certificate of epoch N (either in the mempool or in a block) and then receives another certificate in the same epoch N, the latter MUST be rejected.

  - Any certificate of epoch N+1 MUST refer (through the `endEpochCumScTxCommTreeRoot` field) to a block that includes the certificate of epoch N in its *Sidechain Transactions Cumulative Commitment Tree*. So, for instance, if the mainchain receives a certificate for epoch N included in the mainchain block M, any certificate coming next must refer to an `endEpochCumScTxCommTreeRoot` (and thus to a block) with height equal or higher than M (M, M + 1, M + 2, etc., are all good candidates). Such constraint enforces that a certificate of higher epoch refers to a state of the mainchain that includes the previous certificate. The practical implications of this constraint are:
    - SHALL NOT be possible to have more than one certificate in a block or in the mempool for a given non-ceasable sidechain.
    - The generation of the proof for a certificate of epoch N MUST wait for the certificate of epoch N-1 to be mined.

### Maturity

For sidechains v0 and v1, Zendoo implements a maturity mechanism for the amount of coins transferred to and from any sidechain.

This means that whenever transactions are created with a cross-chain output (sidechain creation, forward transfer, or mainchain backward transfer request), the coins and fees are transferred to the sidechain but the amount is not immediately added to its balance. The coins are marked as immature, and only after some block confirmations, are they included in the sidechain balance. The number of confirmations is set to `10` blocks for mainnet in the chain parameters.
On the mainchain, whenever a transaction including a CSW or a certificate with BTs is received, the validation rules enforce that the total amount of coins transferred from sidechain to mainchain does not exceed the sidechain balance. If a sidechain tries to transfer more coins than its balance, the transaction is rejected.


The concept of maturity also applies to backward transfers in a certificate. During the submission window phase, a certificate can be superseded by another certificate of higher quality. Because of this backward transfers included in a certificate are immature until the certificate is final.

If a sidechain ceases, any backward transfers in an immature certificate are reverted. Zendoo only considers backward transfers included in a top-quality certificate for epoch N mature at the end of the submission window for epoch N + 1 (once a new certificate is submitted during the submission window of epoch N + 1).

Since non-ceasable sidechains don't support CSW, the concept of maturity is unnecessary:

Every cross-chain output or backward transfer MUST be immediately spendable 
Every cross-chain output or backward transfer MUST be immediately added to or removed from the sidechain's balance.
