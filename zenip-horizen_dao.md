## Abstract


The goal of this proposal is to further the decentralization of the Horizen ecosystem by forming a new non-profit foundation to administer the Horizen mainchain, which can be the precursor entity to the establishment of the HorizenDAO. This is the first in a series of steps envisioned to increase the Horizen communityâ€™s involvement in ecosystem governance.



## Motivation

Horizen launched in 2017 as an open-source, privacy-preserving cryptocurrency project. Since that point, the Zen Blockchain Foundation has largely been responsible for overseeing, maintaining and marketing Horizen. There are a number of steps, however, that Horizen can take to become more decentralized and give community members a larger role in governing and contributing to the Horizen ecosystem.

The first of these steps is to form a new foundation to maintain the Horizen mainchain, which is the purpose of this ZenIP. The ultimate goal is for governance of the new foundation, and therefore the entire Horizen project, to be conducted via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Upon formation of the HorizenDAO, we envision a series of improvement proposals to establish new ecosystem governance.  One of these initial proposals may include a fork of the block reward to fund the HorizenDAO, as well as a grant system to enable the contracting of services required to maintain the network.
 


## Specification

The formation and location of the foundation shall be coordinated with legal counsel. We request that funding be provided in furtherance thereof. 

We expect the formation to take approximately 1 month at a cost of approx. $15,000.
